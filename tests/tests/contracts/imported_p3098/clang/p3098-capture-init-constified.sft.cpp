// A postcondition capture's initializer is in the contract assertion, so an
// entity declared outside the assertion is constified there as in the
// predicate (P3098 keeps that constification and exempts only the captures
// themselves, notadragon_wg21 D3098R3: `post [j = ++i] (j)` is an error).
// So `this' there is a pointer to const, and the capture initialized from it
// is one too (CLANG-641: Clang deduced `S *' and accepted the modification;
// it constified nothing in a capture's initializer).  The capture itself is
// deduced as `auto' would be, without the initializer's const, and may be
// modified.
//
// Mirror: gcc/testsuite/g++.dg/contracts/cpp26/lambda-this-modifies-object.C
// in the gnu_gcc fork (its `u').
