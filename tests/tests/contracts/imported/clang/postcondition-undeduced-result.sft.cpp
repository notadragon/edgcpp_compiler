// expression is ill-formed.

// The second diagnostic is error recovery -- with nothing deduced the return
// type falls back to void, and a result name on a void return is separately
// ill-formed.  It is recorded because -verify demands every diagnostic be
// accounted for, not because the cascade is required behaviour.
