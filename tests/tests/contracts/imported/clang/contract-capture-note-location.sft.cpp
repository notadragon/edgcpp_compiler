//
// A contract assertion may not cause a capture that exists only for it, and
// the diagnostic for that carries notes.  On the GCC side the note's location
// was read out of the capture's initializer, which stops being a DECL once
// the capture crosses two lambdas, giving a garbage line number (and a
// tree-check ICE in a checking build).
//
// Clang has never had that bug -- it does not build the note from the
// capture initializer at all.  This test exists as a regression pin: every
// diagnostic below is anchored to the line it belongs on, so a location that
// went wrong would stop matching.  Two and three levels of nesting are
// covered because a one-level-only fix would still be wrong at three, and
// generic lambdas are covered because the original upstream report blamed
// them and they are in fact irrelevant to the GCC bug.  In the generic case
// the function's local and the outer lambda's parameter both get the
// contract-capture diagnostic, each with its notes on its own line.
//
