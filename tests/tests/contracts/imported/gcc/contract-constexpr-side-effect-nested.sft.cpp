/* Undoing a contract predicate's modifications must survive nesting.

   A contract predicate that calls a constexpr function containing its own
   contract assertion, or an [[assume]], starts a second rollback or tracker
   inside the first.  The inner one must restore what it saved and leave the
   outer one in charge, so that the outer predicate's modification is still
   undone (and silently) whether it comes before or after the nested
   construct.  GCC used to perform the modification and warn; the warning's
   tests had this shape because a tracker destructor that cleared rather than
   restored the enclosing state lost it.  */
