// Contract assertions met during a notional or manifestly constant evaluation.
//
// A contract assertion met while evaluating an initializer, an array
// bound or a required constant is evaluated, but what is reported depends on the
// rest of the evaluation.  A false predicate, or one that is not a core constant
// expression, is recorded and evaluation continues.  If the evaluation outside
// the predicates then completes as a constant, each recorded problem is a
// contract violation ([basic.contract.eval]): an error under a terminating
// semantic, a warning under observe, reported once at its own assertion.  If it
// does not complete, everything recorded is discarded -- the variable is
// initialized at run time (an array bound becomes a VLA), or a required constant
// is simply not constant -- and the predicates are evaluated at run time.
//
// Each cell sequences two assertions, each true, false, never constant, constant
// only for a known argument, or reading the argument, against a body that is
// constant, reads the argument, or is never constant, in contexts that decide
// by notional evaluation, that require a constant, or that are not manifestly
// constant-evaluated at all.  The run cells check the run-time half: where the
// notional evaluation fails, the violations are still reported, once each.
