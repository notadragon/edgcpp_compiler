// An array bound whose only non-constant part is a contract predicate is a
// constant bound: the violation is diagnosed and the array is not a VLA.  A
// bound that is not constant apart from its predicate is a VLA, and its
// predicate is left to run time.  (GCC-620: the first diagnostic was emitted
// twice, which a dg-error cannot see; verify.sh tracks it.)

// { dg-additional-options "-fcontracts -fsyntax-only -Wno-vla" }
// -Wno-vla: use_vla's array is a VLA by design, which the testsuite's
// -pedantic-errors would reject; and after the contract error in use, GCC
// recovers by treating that bound as non-constant too.  That the bound is
// constant is shown under observe, where sizeof is usable (see the
// contract test matrix's notional group).
